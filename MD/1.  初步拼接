Analysis and Mapping of DGE Tags

The raw image outputs from the sequencer were transformed into base calls using the Illunina pipeline. 

Prior to mapping the DGE tags, empty tags (no tag sequence between the adaptors), adaptors, low quality tags (tags with unknown sequences “N”), tags with a copy number of 1 (likely sequencing error), and tags that were too long or too short were excluded from the analysis, leaving behind clean tags of 21 nt in length. 

The clean tags were mapped to the transcriptome of C. hongkongensis sequence (Tong et al., 2015) using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). 

Only tags with a perfect match or 1 nt mismatch were further considered and annotated. 

To monitor mapping events on both strands, tags mapping to both sense and antisense sequences were included in the data analysis. 

All tags mapped to the reference sequences were filtered, and the remaining clean tags were designated as unambiguous clean tags. 

Gene expression was normalized using the Reads Per kb per Million (RPKM) method (Mortazavi et al., 2008).
