Abstract
Thermal exposure of sessile marine animals inhabiting estuarine intertidal regions is a matter of serious concern. 
The Hong Kong oyster, Crassostrea hongkongensis is one of the dominant sessile inhabitants of marine intertidal region which undergoes large seasonal temperature fluctuations every year. 
The oyster has developed several adaptation mechanisms to cope with acute thermal stress. 
急性thermal stress.

However, the genetic basis of these mechanisms remain largely unclear. 
To better understand how acute thermal exposure affects the biology of the oyster, 
two cDNA libraries obtained from the gill of oysters exposed to thermal stress and ambient temperature were sequenced 
using the Digital Gene Expression (DGE) tag profiling strategy.

In total, 5.9 and 6.2 million reads were obtained for thermal stress and control libraries respectively, 
with approximately 74.25% and 75.02 % of the reads mapping to the C. hongkongensis reference sequence. 
比对率


A total of 605 differentially expressed transcripts could be detected in the thermal stress group 
as compared to the control group, of which 378 are up-regulated and 227 are down-regulated. 
Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis 
indicated that these Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were enriched with a broad spectrum of biological processes 
and pathways, including those associated with chaperones, antioxidants, immunity, apoptosis and cytoskeletal reorganization. 
Among these significantly enriched pathways, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum 
was the most affected metabolic pathway, which plays an important role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) 
and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) processes.

Experimental Oysters and Thermal Stress
Crassostrea hongkongensis specimens were obtained from an oyster farm in Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, China. 

The healthy adult oysters which will quickly close and spray seawater upon stimulation with stirring the seawater 
were then aerated in sand-filtered natural seawater in a 500-L tank at 23° ± 2°C for 2 weeks prior to the experiment. 
暂养

The oysters were fed twice daily with microalgae, Tetraselmis suecica and Isochrysis galbana. 

For thermal stress treatment, 100 oysters were subjected to heat shock for 1 h in a 100-L tank with pre-warmed (37°C) seawater 
followed by transfer to ambient seawater (23° ± 2°C). 
100只放在37摄氏度里heat shock 一小时

The seawater is static during the treatment with salinity at 20 ppt and pH at 7.2. 

Previous studies indicate that 1 h thermal exposure is stressful to this species (Lang et al., 2009). 

The control group was maintained in ambient seawater (23° ± 2°C) throughout the study.

After 24 h, 10 oysters were randomly sampled from thermal-stressed and control groups.
